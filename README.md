# CyberJawn2.0
Collection of installation scripts centered around the install and configuration of various SDR, mapping, and off-grid software on a Raspberry Pi 4b running DietPi OS.

Place all scripts in your home folder and run each of them individually.  The plan is to "start" with the install_rtlsdr script due to the inclusion of all build dependencies.

THESE ARE ALL IN ALPHA.  THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN TESTED ON A RASPBERRY PI 4B 8GB WITH DIETPI ARMv8 AND LXDE.

A more comprehensive readme will follow in the future.  A "master install" script will come in the future to call each of these install scripts individually.
